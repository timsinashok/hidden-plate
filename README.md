# hidden-plate
This works in hiding the number plate of vehicles. This could be used by online car dealerships which would want to hide the number plate of the car before uploading to the website.

The task of detecting number plate in a image taken from front or back of the car/vehicle is easily achevable however it is difficult to find the number plate in case the number plate is not a complete rectangle. I am working to resolve that issue.
